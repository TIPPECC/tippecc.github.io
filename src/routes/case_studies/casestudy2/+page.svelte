		Case study 2 is the Namibian contribution to TIPPECC. It focuses on the arid zone pastoralist
		rangeland system of the Ovahimba of northern Kunene. Ovahimba have inhabited the region for over
		200 years, surviving several intense droughts. The pastoralist lifestyle is finely attuned to
		its environment, adapting to seasonal and longer-term fluctuations in their resources. However,
		several factors, including population growth and increased sedentarisation have put pressure on
		the whole social-ecological system (SES), making it vulnerable to climate change and subsequent
		regime shifts in their resource base. TIPPECC-Kunene aims to use both traditional ecological
		knowledge and scientific data to determine 1) the probability of climate tipping points leading
		to regime shifts in the SES, and 2) those factors that will cause changes and/or shifts, with an
		emphasis on the role that a climate tipping point(s) will play in this. We further aim to 3)
		co-develop, with affected communities, feasible adaptation strategies to ongoing global change,
		ensuring alignment with inherent coping strategies. TIPPECC Kunene is organised around four main
		objectives, each comprising between one and four sub-projects. Study topics include vegetation
		change and land degradation, livestock foraging ecology, changes in resource access rules,
		options for climate change adaptation and alternative livelihoods, and the role of permanent
		water provisioning in driving economic, social and environmental change.

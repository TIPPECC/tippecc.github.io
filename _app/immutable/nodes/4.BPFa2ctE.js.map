Of Africa’s population of 900 million, roughly 60% live in rural areas of whom most\n\t\t(~80%) rely on groundwater-based community or household supplies for domestic and other water\n\t\tneeds (Funder et al, 2015). Nevertheless, ground water is often ignored in development debates –\n\t\tincluding those on water supply and management. A number of factors make groundwater a\n\t\tpreferable option for rural water supply schemes: groundwater can be easily developed closer to\n\t\thomesteads; is generally of an acceptable quality with low contamination risk; is relatively\n\t\tcheap to develop, is more reliable and drought-proof compared to surface water and is less\n\t\tsusceptible to seasonal and perennial fluctuations. The occurrence of groundwater depends\n\t\tprimarily on the geology, geomorphology and recent and historic rainfall. The\n\t\tinter-relationships between these factors create complex patterns of water availability,\n\t\tquality, reliability, ease of access and sustainability. Climate change will superimpose itself\n\t\tby modifying rainfall and evaporation patterns, raising questions about how such changes may\n\t\taffect groundwater availability and, ultimately, tipping points in rural water supplies for both\n\t\thumans and livestocks. This case study will focus on the Upper Zambezi because of deteriorating\n\t\tsurface water quality (Nyambe et al, 2018), high groundwater salinity and poor inhabitants who\n\t\tdepend on groundwater (Banda et al, 2019).\n\t</blockquote>\n</div>\n"],"names":["textContent","water","leader","insert_hydration","target","div3","anchor"],"mappings":"+OASYA,EAAA,uMAAAC,CAAK,0EAILC,CAAM;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,mPARlBC,EAkCKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA"}

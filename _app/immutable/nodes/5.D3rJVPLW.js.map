It focuses on the arid zone pastoralist\n\t\trangeland social-ecological system (SES) of the Ovahimba of northern Kunene. Ovahimba have\n\t\tinhabited the region for over 200 years, surviving several intense droughts. The pastoralist\n\t\tlifestyle is finely attuned to its environment, adapting to seasonal and longer-term\n\t\tfluctuations in their resources. However, several factors, including population growth and\n\t\tincreased sedentarisation have put pressure on the whole SES, making it vulnerable to potential\n\t\ttipping points in climate and subsequent shifts in their resource base. TIPPECC-Kunene aims to\n\t\tuse both traditional ecological knowledge and scientific data to determine 1) the probability of\n\t\tclimate tipping points leading to regime shifts in the SES, and 2) those factors that will cause\n\t\tchanges and/or shifts, with an emphasis on the role that a climate tipping point(s) will play in\n\t\tthis. We further aim to 3) co-develop, with affected communities, feasible adaptation strategies\n\t\tto ongoing global change, ensuring alignment with inherent coping strategies and traditional\n\t\taccess rules. TIPPECC Kunene is organised around four main objectives, each comprising between\n\t\tone and four sub-projects. Study topics include vegetation change and land degradation,\n\t\tlivestock foraging ecology, changes in resource access rules, options for climate change\n\t\tadaptation and alternative livelihoods, and the role of permanent water provisioning in driving\n\t\teconomic, social and environmental change.\n\t</blockquote>\n</div>\n"],"names":["textContent","income","leader","insert_hydration","target","div3","anchor"],"mappings":"+OASYA,EAAA,sMAAAC,CAAM,0EAINC,CAAM;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,mPARlBC,EAiCKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA"}

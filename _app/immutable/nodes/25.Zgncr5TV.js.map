Through either of these mechanisms, critical thresholds\n\tin the tolerance of water, agricultural or ecosystems may be reached, potentially leading to the collapse\n\tof these systems. Although policy makers in SADC and stakeholders across the sectors of water, agriculture\n\tand biodiversity are in urgent need of probabilistic estimates of such critical tipping points being\n\texceeded over the next few decades, such estimates are currently not available. This project will assist\n\tin addressing this challenge. Through a co-production approach, it will firstly identify key sensitivities\n\tand thresholds in a number of important water, food and biodiversity systems in southern Africa. Secondly,\n\tit will project the likelihood of these systems collapsing over the next few decades through to the\n\tend of the 21st century. Finally, adaptation options will be formulated that can begin to enhance more\n\tintegrated and robust decision making to some of the tipping point related risks that will be considered\n\tin southern Africa. At a regional scale, the project will explore the potential occurrence of “day\n\tzero” events across the major cities and industrial regions of southern Africa. Such tipping points\n\tin water availability may be induced through unprecedented multi-year droughts under climate change,\n\tin combination with urban and industrial growth that lead to enhanced water demand. Transboundary water\n\ttransfers have been proposed as an adaptation to such impacts, for example from the Lesotho in South\n\tAfrica to Gaborone in Botswana, or from the Okavango to Gaborone. This project will assess the feasibility\n\tof the supposed regional adaptation measure. Unprecedented multi-year droughts in combination with\n\toppressive temperatures may also imply tipping points in the cattle industry, maize crop and biodiversity\n\tconservation in southern Africa. The project will explore the probabilities of tipping points, and\n\thow these may enhance other underlying drivers and vulnerabilities in the system. Mechanisms that can\n\tenhance resilience in these contexts will also be explored through engagements with stakeholders. For\n\texample, cross-country national parks and conservation areas that make feasible extensive animal migration\n\thave been proposed as a regional adaptation to such impacts. Across the southern African region tipping\n\tpoints may also be reached in terms of rural water scarcity and oppressive temperatures impacting on\n\tcommunities and their livelihoods. Such tipping points will also be explored and adaptation options\n\twill be sought through a co-production approach with stakeholders.\n</div>\n"],"names":["insert_hydration","target","div8","anchor","append_hydration","span","div0","h1","blockquote","div2","div1","div7","div3","div4","div5","div6","h2"],"mappings":";;;u1BAqCyC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oEA4BzC,+kCA5ByC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oEA4BzC,ibA3DAA,GA2DKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA,EA1DJC,EAAgFF,EAAAG,CAAA,SAChFD,EAKKF,EAAAI,CAAA,EAJJF,EAEIE,EAAAC,CAAA,4BAILH,EAKYF,EAAAM,CAAA,SAEZJ,EAKKF,EAAAO,CAAA,qBAHJL,EAEKK,EAAAC,CAAA,SAGNN,EAMKF,EAAAS,CAAA,qBAJJP,EAAoFO,EAAAC,CAAA,SACpFR,EAAkFO,EAAAE,CAAA,SAClFT,EAAwEO,EAAAG,CAAA,SACxEV,EAAwFO,EAAAI,CAAA,SAGzFX,EAAwCF,EAAAc,CAAA"}

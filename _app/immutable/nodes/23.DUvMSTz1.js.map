This WP will develop such a base, in the\n\tform of a range of indicators of climate change impacts across the sectors of water, agriculture and\n\tbiodiversity that will be used to inform engagements with various actors to co-develop appropriate\n\tadaptation actions. These measures will range from indices of meteorological and hydrological drought,\n\tto simulations of soil moisture, indices of heat-stress in cattle, simulations of crop yield and estimates\n\tof soil degradation. Where possible actors will be engaged to include their experiences of using such\n\tindicators, which have been most useful and which not, and then how can these be improved? The indicators\n\twill thus be based on the comprehensive set of projections of future climate change described in WP1,\n\tand will be also worked into engagements with users up front in efforts to co-design useful outputs\n\tand then options for effective actions for dissemination will be work-shopped and co-produced further\n\tthrough WP3. It is expected that these products will find wide application across the southern African\n\tregion in terms of climate change impacts – far beyond the reach of this project. However, the indicators\n\tare also of critical importance for the assessment of regional tipping points as per WP4 of the project.\n</div>\n"],"names":["insert_hydration","target","div10","anchor","append_hydration","span","div0","h1","blockquote","div2","div1","div9","div3","div4","div5","div6","div7","div8","h2"],"mappings":";;oiCAsCyC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0GAgBzC,wwCAhByC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0GAgBzC,yeAhDAA,GAgDKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA,EA/CJC,EAAgFF,EAAAG,CAAA,SAChFD,EAKKF,EAAAI,CAAA,EAJJF,EAEIE,EAAAC,CAAA,4BAILH,EAIYF,EAAAM,CAAA,SAEZJ,EAKKF,EAAAO,CAAA,qBAHJL,EAEKK,EAAAC,CAAA,SAGNN,EAQKF,EAAAS,CAAA,qBANJP,EAAoFO,EAAAC,CAAA,SACpFR,EAAoFO,EAAAE,CAAA,SACpFT,EAAgFO,EAAAG,CAAA,SAChFV,EAAwEO,EAAAI,CAAA,SACxEX,EAAwFO,EAAAK,CAAA,SACxFZ,EAAkFO,EAAAM,CAAA,SAGnFb,EAAwCF,EAAAgB,CAAA"}

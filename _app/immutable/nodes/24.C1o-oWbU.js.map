Addressing the need\n\tfor spatially explicit and problem-tailored information on future climate, the system will provide\n\tfunctions for accessing climate projection data (WP1) at user-defined points/areas of interest and\n\tfor the dynamic calculation of related climate indicators (WP2) on demand. Moreover, the system will\n\tprovide functions to initiate and control the processing of ensembles of projections, to manage and\n\tshare the outputs of user-defined data analyses, and to visualize results by means of graphs and maps.\n\tThese outputs will be designed with the users to ensure that the visualizations are indeed useful.\n\tGeneral metadata and detailed provenance information will be stored for each created dataset to ease\n\tfurther use. It should be noted that a climate service such as the one to be developed here does not\n\tcurrently exist in the SADC region, yet there is an immense demand for such a capability. An important\n\tstakeholder in the co-production process to develop the Climate Services Gateway is SASSCAL itself.\n</div>\n"],"names":["host_website","leader","group","insert_hydration","target","div7","anchor"],"mappings":"4cAUYA,CAAY;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,8EAWZC,CAAM,iLAONC,CAAK;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,8RAtBjBC,EA4CKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA"}

Moreover, a new set of high-resolution regional climate change projections will be generated\n\twith the new coupled ocean-atmosphere RCMs CCAM (WITS-GCI) and ROM (GERICS) using CMIP6 data as forcing.\n\tIn order to build up an ensemble of regional climate change projections, the RCMs CCAM and ROM will\n\tdownscale selected CMIP6 projections to a spatial resolution of about 8 km for a selected domain in\n\tsouthern Africa. These will be the first coupled ocean-atmosphere projections of future climate change\n\tever obtained for the southern African region, and will include feedbacks between the Agulhas current\n\tand Benguela upwelling system and atmospheric circulation over southern Africa. The newly performed\n\tregional climate change projections will be stored at a public database and made available for other\n\tscientists from different sectors and SASSCAL projects. This dissemination will take place through\n\tthe projectâ€™s Climate Service Gateway (WP3).\n</div>\n"],"names":["move","leader","group","insert_hydration","target","div6","anchor"],"mappings":"gdAUYA,CAAI;AAAA;AAAA,2EAUJC,CAAM,+KAONC,CAAK;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sOArBjBC,EAyCKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA"}

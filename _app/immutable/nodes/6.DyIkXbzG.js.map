African mammals adapted to past episodes of\n\t\tclimate change by moving between eastern and southern Africa along has been termed the ‘drought\n\t\tcorridor’. In pluvial periods the equatorial rainforest expanded to block the drought corridor,\n\t\tbut in dry periods movements along it are key to understanding not only the current distribution\n\t\tof eastern and southern African mammals, but also how they were able to adapt to climate change.\n\t\tThe severity of climate change in southern Africa is projected to be such that even large\n\t\texisting trans frontier conservation areas (TFCAs) such as the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA-TFCA) may\n\t\tnot encompass the required rainfall gradient for the African mega fauna to survive. Land\n\t\tuse/land cover change mapping will be used to identify the key areas where wildlife migratory\n\t\tcorridors along the drought corridor are today blocked by human activities such as agriculture.\n\t\tThe results from the mapping of available surface water along the drought corridor will be used\n\t\tto identify areas of existing and future conflict between water dependent wildlife and people,\n\t\tand the extent to which available groundwater resources can be used to compensate for\n\t\tincreasingly restricted access to surficial water in the future. Mapping will assess the extent\n\t\tto which existing Community Based National Resource Management and other wildlife and wilderness\n\t\tbased tourism initiatives can be expanded within the drought corridor to ensure its viability in\n\t\tthe face of declining outputs from traditional agriculture in Southern Africa. Biodiversity\n\t\ttipping points along the drought corridor will be established from the regional climate analysis\n\t\tand used alongside those for traditional agriculture to establish the key spatial areas and\n\t\tpoints in time at which such key adaptive strategies such as corridors that link conservation\n\t\tareas between eastern and southern Africa, to form a new TFCA such as the Kalahari-Rift Valley\n\t\t(KALARIVA) (Perkins, 2019) must be in place.\n\t</blockquote>\n</div>\n"],"names":["insert_hydration","target","div3","anchor","append_hydration","span","div0","h1","div2","div1","blockquote"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;umCAKAA,EAyCKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA,EAxCJC,EAAwFF,EAAAG,CAAA,SACxFD,EAGKF,EAAAI,CAAA,EAFJF,EAA0DE,EAAAC,CAAA,4BAI3DH,EAKKF,EAAAM,CAAA,qBAHJJ,EAEKI,EAAAC,CAAA,SAGNL,EA0BYF,EAAAQ,CAAA"}

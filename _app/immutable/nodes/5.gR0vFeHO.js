It focuses on the arid zone pastoralist
		rangeland social-ecological system (SES) of the Ovahimba of northern Kunene. Ovahimba have
		inhabited the region for over 200 years, surviving several intense droughts. The pastoralist
		lifestyle is finely attuned to its environment, adapting to seasonal and longer-term
		fluctuations in their resources. However, several factors, including population growth and
		increased sedentarisation have put pressure on the whole SES, making it vulnerable to potential
		tipping points in climate and subsequent shifts in their resource base. TIPPECC-Kunene aims to
		use both traditional ecological knowledge and scientific data to determine 1) the probability of
		climate tipping points leading to regime shifts in the SES, and 2) those factors that will cause
		changes and/or shifts, with an emphasis on the role that a climate tipping point(s) will play in
		this. We further aim to 3) co-develop, with affected communities, feasible adaptation strategies
		to ongoing global change, ensuring alignment with inherent coping strategies and traditional
		access rules. TIPPECC Kunene is organised around four main objectives, each comprising between
		one and four sub-projects. Study topics include vegetation change and land degradation,
		livestock foraging ecology, changes in resource access rules, options for climate change
		adaptation and alternative livelihoods, and the role of permanent water provisioning in driving
		economic, social and environmental change.`,v;return l=new Q({}),c=new B({}),{c(){t=g("div"),o=g("span"),o.innerHTML=I,$=f(),i=g("div"),r=g("h1"),r.textContent=L,x=f(),K(l.$$.fragment),y=f(),s=g("div"),K(c.$$.fragment),S=f(),d=g("div"),d.innerHTML=P,E=f(),h=g("blockquote"),h.textContent=k,this.h()},l(e){t=u(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var a=T(t);o=u(a,"SPAN",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(o)!=="svelte-226gk9"&&(o.innerHTML=I),$=p(a),i=u(a,"DIV",{class:!0});var _=T(i);r=u(_,"H1",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(r)!=="svelte-8700zj"&&(r.textContent=L),x=p(_),j(l.$$.fragment,_),_.forEach(C),y=p(a),s=u(a,"DIV",{class:!0});var b=T(s);j(c.$$.fragment,b),S=p(b),d=u(b,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(d)!=="svelte-wd18fd"&&(d.innerHTML=P),b.forEach(C),E=p(a),h=u(a,"BLOCKQUOTE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(h)!=="svelte-zp83v4"&&(h.textContent=k),a.forEach(C),this.h()},h(){m(o,"class","chip static-courser bg-[#D17208] mt-4 text-white"),m(r,"class","content-heading"),m(i,"class","flex"),m(d,"class","pl-4 text-lg"),m(s,"class","flex pt-2 pb-4"),m(h,"class","content-blockquote"),m(t,"class","content-div")},m(e,a){N(e,t,a),n(t,o),n(t,$),n(t,i),n(i,r),n(i,x),D(l,i,null),n(t,y),n(t,s),D(c,s,null),n(s,S),n(s,d),n(t,E),n(t,h),v=!0},p:z,i(e){v||(q(l.$$.fragment,e),q(c.$$.fragment,e),v=!0)},o(e){O(l.$$.fragment,e),O(c.$$.fragment,e),v=!1},d(e){e&&C(t),H(l),H(c)}}}class X extends W{constructor(t){super(),A(this,t,null,U,V,{})}}export{X as component};
